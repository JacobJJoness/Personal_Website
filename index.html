      Howdy, my name is Jacob Jones, and yes I do say hello like that. As you may
       guess I am from South Texas, in a coastal city called Corpus Christi. Most 
       things to do growing up in Corpus were fishing, at home hobbies, and a lot 
       of various restaurants I mean like a lot. That being said I had to grow up 
       creative, and a lot of my creativity is born of my natural curiosities and 
       enjoyment of learning. I got into programming my second year of highschool, 
       and have maintained steady coursework to improve my skill since then. However, 
       despite this I would honestly say my biggest passion is problem solving, and then 
       coding of course. I truly see my future profession as an artform beautifully 
       contrived using practical mathematics, and logic. Outside of my degree, I enjoy
        drawing, cooking, fishing, gardening, reading, etc. I'd like to consider myself 
        a jack of all trades, and a lifelong learner. My dream is to become a software developer
         for Amazon. Mainly, due to the fact I feel they will be a workplace where I am always 
         challenged to learn new things, and keep a forward thinking mindset and appreciate the 
         final product for the end user. Please look through my website if you'd to learn more about me, and I am
         excited to meet those who reach out!

        &#8226; My intention was never to become a computer scientist. I took the course as a required tech credit
        in my sophomore year of highschool, and have been immersed in the discipline ever since.

        &#8226; I learned how to build a computer my freshman year of college, and I love christmas so I made the

      <li class="list-spacing">&#8226; In addition to programming, drawing holds a special interest to me. I prefer to 
        attempt realism than to draw comically.
       </li>

      <li class="list-spacing">&#8226; My secret passion is cooking, but not for others, or for any monetary gain. I 
        simply enjoy the action, the experiement, and the result.

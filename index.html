      Howdy, my name is Jacob Jones, and yes I do say hello like that. As you may
       guess I am from South Texas, in a coastal city called Corpus Christi. Most 
       things to do growing up in Corpus were fishing, at home hobbies, and a lot 
       of various restaurants I mean like a lot. That being said I had to grow up 
       creative, and a lot of my creativity is born of my natural curiosities and 
       enjoyment of learning. I got into programming my second year of highschool, 
       and have maintained steady coursework to improve my skill since then. However, 
       despite this I would honestly say my biggest passion is problem solving, and then 
       coding of course. I truly see my future profession as an artform beautifully 
       contrived using practical mathematics, and logic. Outside of my degree, I enjoy
        drawing, cooking, fishing, gardening, reading, etc. I'd like to consider myself 
        a jack of all trades, and a lifelong learner. My dream is to become a software developer
         for Amazon. Mainly, due to the fact I feel they will be a workplace where I am always 
         challenged to learn new things, and keep a forward thinking mindset and appreciate the 
         final product for the end user. Please enjoy the rest of the site. There are many small 
         details etched to this work in progress site.

        &#8226; I completely and utterly had no intention to fall in love with computer science 
        the way I have. I don't mean that to be sappy, I took it for a blow off credit in highschool.
        I even made sure the class was a blow off ahead of time. Well the teach that had been there for 30
        years or so had retired. A new one(who is now number 2 in the state of texas for AP text scores) 
        who pushed us, and we were hooked.
